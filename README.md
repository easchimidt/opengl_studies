# Author: Emanuel A Schimidt
# Based on Vinicius Godoy Mendon√ßa OpenGL project in Java

This project is being developed both in Linux (Ubuntu) and MacOS.

Nowadays the main focus of the project is to study OpenGL, so there is not much effort in
building an application that is multiplatform.

This is the reason there are actually two projects. There are quite the same, but the main
one being built for MacOS, and the other one in Linux, with quite outdated tools.

As I said, this is for learning purpose. In the future I would like to build a generic
CMakeList that can build to MacOS, Linux and Windows.
